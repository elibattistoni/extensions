# Color Picker Extension

A simple system-wide color picker. The color picker can be triggered with a standalone command or as part of the menu bar command. The menu bar shows the last nine picked colors. The Organize Colors command can be used to see all colors. From the Organize Colors command and the Generate Colors command you can select multiple colors and create color palettes that will be saved on the Local Storage.
